# Linux Terminal

This document outlines the configuration tweaks needed to go full-terminal on a work laptop/computer.

As a functional work station we need, at a minimum:

- Text Editor/IDE
- Web Browser
- Window toggle/switcher/splitter
- System information
  - Battery level

We will also need to do the following settings tweaks:

- Boot from console directly, with an easy alias/command to turn on graphical interface just in case we need to do a videocall, etc.

## Text editor

The easy one is **Nano**, already installed.
We've also got **Micro**.

Then we can go with **Neovim** and such.

## Web Browser
